# git-challenge-1

## Description

The motivation for this challenge was to better improve the html and css code for the website. I improved on the code so that the website could function better and provide the user a bettter experience. I solved the issue with the "search engine optimization" button. The button now directs the user to the information regarding the "search engine optimization". I also fixed typos that were in the css to include the "calibri" option in the font-family tags. I then reaaranged some of the CSS so that way it was more organized to resemble the layout of the HTML file. I then changed the html title to "Horiseon Homepage" to better represent the website. I learned that sometimes a problem with the code ca nbe as simple as including missing code, or including a missing character. 

## Installation

I started with creating a new repository for this challenge on github. using git bash I created the new repository, I used the commands: git config --global init.defaultBranch main, mkdir git-challenge-1. I then used cd git-challenge-1 and created a index file with touch index.html. Then I checked the file with git status and then tracked the html file with git add -A and then commited the file using got commit -m "initial commit". I then created the remote repository in github with the same name git-challenge-1 and copied the SSH URL and used it in the command git remote add origin <SSH URL>, git branch -M main, git push -u origin main to connect the local repository to the remote repository on github. From here I had issues copying the challenge to the new repository. What I did was copied the challenge index.html file and css from the development folder in the challenge file that was located in the class repository and copied them to the new git-challenge-1 file from the VS code text editor. I ran a git push and git pull to confirm that the updates were pushed up to the remote repository on github.    
## Usage

The website still works as was intended only now all the top 3 tabs at the top of webpage function like they are suppose to. The title of the html has been changed as well so that it informs the user that they are at the "Horiseon" homepage
